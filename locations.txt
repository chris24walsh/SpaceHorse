Type A location: Sun/Star of whatever sort
Causes damage if too close.

Type B location: Planet/Moon
Can be landed on, but costs fuel to take-off depending on planet size.

Type C location: Asteroid/Comet
Causes damage if collision without higher level engines. Usually only a mining spot.

Type D location: Space station/outpost
Can be docked at. Never a mining spot and never low tech level.

Type E location: Gas giants/clouds/nebulae
Can refuel with gas scoops but may cause damage if too close and may disable scanner/radar.

Type F location: Other starships
Like a space station but smaller and not stationary. Possibly hostile.

Things that can be found (limited by tech level):
1. Spaceport (never at low tech level; to refill fuel tanks, recharge batteries, and assisted take-off)
2. Goods Trader (to buy/sell commodities)
3. Equipment Trader (never at low tech level; to buy/sell equipment)
4. Free stuff (goods/info/equipment)
5. Mining spot (if low tech level, i.e. if high tech presume already mined or claimed)
