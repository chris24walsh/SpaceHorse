2D Space Exploration Game

Primary goal: Return home.

1. Go to next star system:

1.1. Discover exact navigational coordinates
1.2. Install interstellar engine
1.3. Accumulate large enough energy reserves to activate interstellar engine

2. Get the stuff above from locations within the system:

2.1. Travel to other locations within the system (costs fuel)
2.2. Interact with locations
2.3. Defend against dangers (requires equipment and energy)

---

2.1. Travel to other locations within the system:
2.1.1. Speed up/down (costs fuel)
2.1.2. Turn direction (costs fuel)
2.1.3. Detect new locations (space radar long distance on minimap, and maybe scanner for short distance info)

2.2. Interact with locations (planets/space stations/asteroids/gas clouds/other ships):
2.2.1. Dock
2.2.2. Leave (costs fuel depending on size of location?)
2.2.3. Mine for fuel (or fuel ingredients?)/energy/commodities
2.2.4. Buy/Sell/Store fuel/energy/equipment/commodities
2.2.5. Upgrade equipment (better radar/scanner/cargo hold/engines/guns/shields/armor/mining lasers/gas scoops/etc)
2.2.6. Get info about other locations/dangers/star system coordinates/equipment/trade opportunities/etc.

2.3. Defend against dangers (pirates/enemies/police/natural hazards/artificial hazards)
2.3.1. Run away from danger
2.3.2. Destroy danger
2.3.3. Take damage
2.3.4. Lose cargo/equipment/fuel/energy/ship
2.3.5. Get killed
2.3.6. Detect danger in advance

Types of location:
Type A. Star (don't get too close!)
Type B. Planet/Moon (costing more fuel to leave again)
Type C. Asteroid/Comet (possible docking/collision difficulty?)
Type D. Space stations/outposts (easy docking and leaving)
Type E. Gas giants/clouds/nebulae (can be mined for fuel with the right equipment)
Type F. Other ships (like space stations but might chase you and rob/destroy/help you)

Types of cargo:
Type A. Fuel (stored fuel tanks)
Type B. Energy (stored in batteries necessarily)
Type C. Equipment (either installed in suitable ship or stored in cargo hold)
Type D. Trade goods (stored in cargo hold)

Types of equipment:
Type A. Radar (long distance visibility on minimap, maybe upgrade to show smaller type locations/ships and/or more area)
Type B. Scanner (get short distance info on a location, maybe upgrade to better info from further away getting past interference)
Type C. Weapon (requires energy to use, upgrading to more damage/less energy)
Type D. Cargo hold (for storing trade goods)
Type E. Fuel tanks (for storing fuel reserves)
Type F. Batteries (for storing energy reserves)
Type G. Interstellar engine (basic jump to adjacent system, maybe upgrading to jumping to further systems)
Type H. Starship (determines basic armour/health, and limits types and levels of equipment that can be installed)
Type I. Mining Lasers (for mining rocky stuff)
Type J. Gas scoops (for getting fuel from gases)
Type K. Armour (extra health)
Type L. Shields (extra health that uses energy reserves to recharge unless disabled)
Type M. Energy generator (basic solar, maybe upgrading to fission/fusion, etc)
Type N. Conventional engines (for propulsion within a star system, upgrading to more speed/manoevrability/less fuel consumption)
